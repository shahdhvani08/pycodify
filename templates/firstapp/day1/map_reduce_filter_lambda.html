<h1>Lambda, filter, reduce and map</h1>
<br>

<p>Python provides several functions which enable a <b>functional approach</b> to programming. These functions are all convenience features in that they can be written in Python fairly easily.</p>

<p><b>Functional programming</b> is all about <b>expressions</b>. We may say that the Functional programming is an expression oriented programming.

Expression oriented functions of Python provides are:</p>
<ul>
<li>map(aFunction, aSequence)</li>
<li>filter(aFunction, aSequence)</li>
<li>reduce(aFunction, aSequence)</li>
<li>lambda</li>
<li>list comprehension</li>
</ul>

<h2>map</h2>
<br>

<p>One of the common things we do with list and other sequences is applying an operation to each item and collect the result. For example, updating all the items in a list can be done easily with a for loop:</p>

<pre class = "brush:py;">
>>> items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> squared = []
>>> for x in items:
	squared.append(x ** 2)
>>> squared
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
>>> 
</pre>
<p>Since this is such a common operation, actually, we have a built-in feature that does most of the work for us. The map(aFunction, aSequence) function applies a passed-in function to each item in an iterable object and returns a list containing all the function call results.</p>

<pre class = "brush:py;">
>>> items = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> 
>>> def sqr(x): 
		return x ** 2

>>> list(map(sqr, items))
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
>>> 
</pre>
<p>We passed in a user-defined function applied to each item in the list. <code>map</code> calls <code>sqr</code> on each list item and collects all the return values into a new list.
Because <code>map</code> expects a function to be passed in, it also happens to be one of the places where lambda routinely appears:</p>
<pre class = "brush:py;">
>>> list(map((lambda x: x **2), items))
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
>>> 
</pre>
<p>In the short example above, the <code>lambda</code> function squares each item in the items list.As shown earlier, map is defined like this:</p>
<pre class = "brush:py;">map(aFunction, aSequence)</pre>
<p>While we still use <code>lamda</code> as a <b>aFunction</b>, we can have a list of <code>functions</code> as <b>aSequence</b>:</p>
<pre class = "brush:py;">
def square(x):
        return (x**2)
def cube(x):
        return (x**3)

funcs = [square, cube]
for r in range(5):
    value = map(lambda x: x(r), funcs)
    print value
Output:

[0, 0]
[1, 1]
[4, 8]
[9, 27]
[16, 64]
</pre>

<p><b>More examples:</b></p>
<pre class = "brush:py;">
>>> def fahrenheit(T):
...     return ((float(9)/5)*T + 32)
... 
>>> def celsius(T):
...     return (float(5)/9)*(T-32)
... 
>>> temperatures = (36.5, 37, 37.5, 38, 39)
>>> F = map(fahrenheit, temperatures)
>>> C = map(celsius, F)
>>>
>>> temperatures_in_Fahrenheit = list(map(fahrenheit, temperatures))
>>> temperatures_in_Celsius = list(map(celsius, temperatures_in_Fahrenheit))
>>> print(temperatures_in_Fahrenheit)
[97.7, 98.60000000000001, 99.5, 100.4, 102.2]
>>> print(temperatures_in_Celsius)
[36.5, 37.00000000000001, 37.5, 38.00000000000001, 39.0]
>>> 
</pre>
<p>In the example above we haven't used lambda. By using lambda, we wouldn't have had to define and name the functions fahrenheit() and celsius(). You can see this in the following interactive session:</p>

<pre class = "brush:py;">
>>> C = [39.2, 36.5, 37.3, 38, 37.8] 
>>> F = list(map(lambda x: (float(9)/5)*x + 32, C))
>>> print(F)
[102.56, 97.7, 99.14, 100.4, 100.03999999999999]
>>> C = list(map(lambda x: (float(5)/9)*(x-32), F))
>>> print(C)
[39.2, 36.5, 37.300000000000004, 38.00000000000001, 37.8]
>>> 
</pre>
<p><code>map()</code> can be applied to more than one list. The lists have to have the same length. <code>map()</code> will apply its <code>lambda</code> function to the elements of the argument lists, i.e. it first applies to the elements with the 0th index, then to the elements with the 1st index until the n-th index is reached:</p>
<pre class = "brush:py;">
>>> a = [1,2,3,4]
>>> b = [17,12,11,10]
>>> c = [-1,-4,5,9]
>>> list(map(lambda x,y:x+y, a,b))
[18, 14, 14, 14]
>>> list(map(lambda x,y,z:x+y+z, a,b,c))
[17, 10, 19, 23]
>>> list(map(lambda x,y,z : 2.5*x + 2*y - z, a,b,c))
[37.5, 33.0, 24.5, 21.0]
>>> 
</pre>

<p>We can see in the example above that the parameter x gets its values from the list a, while y gets its values from b and z from list c. </p>

<h2>Filtering</h2>
<hr>

<p><b>Syntax</b></p>
<pre class = "brush:py;">
filter(function, sequence) 
</pre>
offers an elegant way to filter out all the elements of a sequence "sequence", for which the function function returns True. i.e. an item will be produced by the iterator result of <code>filter(function, sequence)</code> if item is included in the sequence "sequence" and if function(item) returns True. </p>

<p>In other words: The function <code>filter(f,l)</code> needs a function f as its first argument. f has to return a Boolean value, i.e. either True or False. This function will be applied to every element of the list l. Only if f returns True will the element be produced by the iterator, which is the return value of filter(function, sequence).</p> 

<p>In the following example, we filter out first the odd and then the even elements of the sequence of the first 11 Fibonacci numbers: </p>
<pre class = "brush:py;">
>>> fibonacci = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
>>> odd_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2, fibonacci))
>>> print(odd_numbers)
[1, 1, 3, 5, 13, 21, 55]
>>> even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, fibonacci))
>>> print(even_numbers)
[0, 2, 8, 34]
>>> 
>>> 
>>> # or alternatively:
... 
>>> even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 -1, fibonacci))
>>> print(even_numbers)
[0, 2, 8, 34]
>>> 
</pre>
<h2>Reduce</h2>
<hr>
<p><code>Reduce</code> is a really useful function for performing some computation on a list and returning the result. For example, if you wanted to compute the product of a list of integers.</p>

<p>So the normal way you might go about doing this task in python is using a basic for loop:</p>

<pre class = "brush:py;">
>>> L = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> result = L[0]
>>> for x in L[1:]:
	result = result * x
>>> result
24
>>> 
</pre>
<p>Let's make use of reduce for the above problem:</p>

<pre class = "brush:py;">
>>> myreduce( (lambda x, y: x * y), [1, 2, 3, 4])
24
</pre>
